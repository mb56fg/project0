        <p> I don't understand GIT</p>
        <p> Starting from Ground Zero</p>
        <p> Step 1 is to create a fle on your local computer. I think temporally this has to be step 1</p>
        <p> Let's call that file index1.html</p>
        <p> The word repository is ambiguous. There is a local repository and a remote repository (presumeably github)</p>
        <p> It is implied that a repository is a folder that contains files and subfolders</p>
        <p> So say after index1.html is created</p>
        <p> I do a git init, which I assume creates a local repository</p>
        <p> Conceptually I don't know how to think of this local repository? Is is a folder a directory? </p>
        <p> I guess whatever directory the file is in is now a repository??</p>
        <p> git add -A to let git know you want to include all-A changed files in the next commit.</p>
        <p> git commit -m "message" to commit changes to the repository</p>
        <p> Now create a repository on github with same name as directory you are working locally in</p>
        <p> Because the name of your local repository is implicitly the name of your directory?</p>
        <p> What name do you give your repository on git</p>
        <p> git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/project0.git</p>
