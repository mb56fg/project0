Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

So there are some unused files in my directory because I don't dare delete them locally and risk screwing
up my origin repo. Meaning I delete is locally and then do a push and get some error that there
is zero chance I can debug. I don't understand git.

index5.html is my home page.

index2.html , index3.html , index4.html , index6.html, index7.html and

index8.html are other pages.

index6.scss and index6.css and style.css are my scss and css files.
